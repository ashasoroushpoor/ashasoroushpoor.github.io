director: Martha Coolidge
rating:
year: 1976
description: The movie is supposed to be a retelling of the assault to the director at the age of 16, but in the middle it takes an unexpected turn when the male actor talks about his urge to harm the actress when playing the scene, and it becomes a docudrama after that exploring emptions and thoughts of the actor and actress. one of the magnificent movies that has been lost in time and been victim to mysoginistic path of the media.
