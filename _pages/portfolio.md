My name is Asha Soroushpoor. I was born in Tehran Iran in spring of 2000s. I recently got my bachelor degree in Computer Science from University of Tehran.

This is my personal website. It contains 3 parts. 

First I will talk about movies, series, video games or books that I find special. Not all are necessarily good and not all good ones are included. The reason they are special might be personal or non-personal.

Second I will put update here on my academic career and academic interests.

Last but not least, I will put out my opinion in the blog here. I will try to update regularly.
