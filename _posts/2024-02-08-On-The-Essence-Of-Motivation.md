What is the motivation, who is motivated and how we can prove it.

Last few months I've been very busy. And part of my time was dedicated into writing motivation letters and SOPs. I didn't where to start and what I should write, so I sought help. And no matter what I wrote there was always people agreeing and disagreeing with my statements. Some thought I should be more professional, others suggested that I write more about my feeling and why I am a special case in the path I'm pursuing. Some told me to be specific about my experience while others thought this might present me as a fraud who wants to cheat his way by complicated manner. Here I tend to step-by-step guide you through my mind journey while I had this struggle.

First, natural language is more complicated than most think it is. I'm not talking about its syntax or design. About what it supposed to do. This is the most important question, what is the intended purpose of natural language. If you have a pessimistic view you might say that it is there, so we don't feel alone. No-one can understand the other so in the end all we have is this illusion created by our words and our touches, so there might be something or someone out there like us. This is not all wrong, after all I don't know you, so I'm basically talking to myself here. Maybe that's why I created this website, to run away from my loneliness by talking to my imaginary audience.

But let us use a more practical model. We use natural language mainly for two things, asking a request or responding to one. So it must not be that much different from how computers communicate with each other. The **big** difference is that we are sometimes responding to a request which we don't know. Like when a university asks you to tell them what are your motivations. How deep you want me to explain?, how much are you willing to understand?. Thinking about this we are faced with similar situations every day. The coffee shop always serves me an Americano with 70/30 ratio of Robusta/Arabica. How does he know that, because the guy before him told him that, and the guy before that guy knew me very well. So when I ask for coffee there, there is an unwritten rule that what I mean by coffee because coffee has a broad range of meaning.

But about motivation the story is a little different, before going any further I tend to explain a summary of what I think true motivation is.

Motivation has many levels to its definition, on the lowest level it is the most fundamental question of all as Camus indicates in "Le Mythe de sysphe. Why you do not kill yourself?. Every morning you wake up, and you start to do what you want to do what keeps you from not giving up due to emptiness of life. On highest level it is a question as simple as why doing this, and not others.

The problem is that there is no defined conviction that on what level people need motivation to be explained. And more importantly the understanding of each level depends on a person's personal experience and journey. For example, I totally reject this question on lowest level. I believe that a motivated person will not ask such question since the essence of motivation is something hard-coded so deep inside your soul that cannot be explained. I like analyzing and formalizing, this is not something which I'm good at, but extensive experience through my life made me this way. Like right now, I'm writing this essay without having any thoughts previously about this, but words are coming on the keyboard. Most importantly I am so focused that I don't think about anything else, my mind know how to be this person and when I am this person I don't think about what this person is.

A general definition of motivation is positive answer to "are you comfortable with what you are?". So for you to explain what motivates you, you must make the other side of the conversation to understand as much as he/she can about what you are. But is this what happens in real life?

This definition of motivation has some consequences. For example if someone is writing about his/her motivation it must be something that no-one else can write. Since what you are is different from anyone else. But in reality something far worse is happening, the true identity of people is reduced to what the industry wants them to be. This causes two main problems. First is that people do not realize who they are. Second that the industry do not realize who they need. Since every-one wants to win the competition they reduce their motivation to the highest level, so they can make the other side accept who they are. It's like the coffee shop serving everyone Latte since no-one hates it, and it is too much of a bother to ask everyone's opinion.
